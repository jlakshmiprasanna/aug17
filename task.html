        In 2007, Charan made his film debut as the leading actor in Chirutha, an action film directed by Puri Jagannadh
        which completed 50 days in 178 direct cinemas and 15 other shifted cinemas.[19] He played the role of Charan, an
        ex-convict seeking to kill his father's murderer. Rediff.com praised his performance, stating: "Ram Charan is
        quite promising. Dance and action appear to be forte. He is rather graceful in the dance numbers. He also stays
        clear of any oblique reference to his star father by way of dialogue or adopting any particular mannerism or
        style." His performance in the film earned him the Filmfare Award for Best Male Debut – South and the Nandi
        Special Jury Award.After the release of his second film, the fantasy film Magadheera (2009), Charan established
        himself as one of the leading contemporary actors in Tollywood. The film, in which he played dual roles, was
        directed by S. S. Rajamouli, and Charan's performance was critically acclaimed.
